# agent-containers

A bunch of container-ed AI agents with some simple instructions for running
them against your local code in slightly safer ways.

Where possible, I've documented how to persist configuration from session to
session as well. As a lot of these agents store your API credentials _in_ their
configuration files, you should be really cautious about checking in config to
some place like your dotfiles repo.
